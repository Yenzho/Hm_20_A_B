## Project Description

This project consists of multiple tasks involving statistical analysis and hypothesis testing on various datasets related to Pokemon and experimental treatments.

### Task 1: Drug Effectiveness Analysis
- Evaluate if there is a difference in the effect of two drugs.
- Visually confirm the results.

### Task 2: Fertilizer Experiment
- Use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare distributions of results between different groups of cucumber plants treated with water, fertilizer, and mineral water.
- Determine if there is an effect of fertilizer compared to mineral water.
- Provide visualizations using boxplots or histograms to illustrate the differences.

### Task 3: Cookie Cats A/B Test
- Analyze the impact of moving the first gate in the game Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40 on player retention.
- Conduct statistical tests to draw conclusions.
- Create visualizations to support the analysis.

### Task 4: Pokemon A/B Testing
- Investigate if grass-type Pokemon have a stronger normal attack than rock-type Pokemon.
- Determine statistically significant differences.
- Support findings with visualizations.

### Task 5: Pokemon Speed Analysis
- Assess if water-type Pokemon are faster on average than normal-type Pokemon.
- Conduct statistical tests and visualize the results.

### Task 6: Pokemon Serum Experiment
- Determine if a serum administered to certain Pokemon affects their speed.
- Conduct statistical tests and provide evidence to support the conclusion.

### Task 7: Legendary Pokemon Analysis
- Investigate if legendary Pokemon have higher HP, Attack, Defense sum and product compared to non-legendary Pokemon.
- Conduct statistical tests and visualize the differences.

### Task 8: Defense Class Comparison
- Assess if certain classes of Pokemon identified by Professor Oak have statistically significant differences in defense level.
- Conduct statistical tests and provide conclusions.
